# AgentPatientStimuli
Developing sets of simple agent-patient visual stimuli


These are the files and folders:

Syntactic Complexity Stims: visual inspiration for shapes

Behavioral testing: everything to do with preliminary testing of our stimuli (feedback from Google forms and Mechanical Turk)

Experiment: the experiment weâ€™re actually presenting to people, and all its accoutrements

AgentPatientStimuli.m - Pilot version 1, 5 verbs, 4 agents, sentences too fast
AgentPatient33.m - Pilot version 2, 3 agents, 3 verbs, with questions. 

Keynote stills: Keynote presentations full of still images, some of which will or have become jpg images used in the Psychtoolbox script

Obsolete: things that were at one point needed to make other things and which we keep around in case we need to remake the other things

README.md: whoa, meta
